1) when clg team, results in two copies:
        [
        Manager {
            name: 'clg test',
            id: 1,
            email: 'm@m.com',
            officeNumber: 1
        },
        Engineer { name: 'e', id: 2, email: 'e@e.com', github: undefined },
        Intern { name: 'i', id: 3, email: 'i@i.com', school: undefined }
        ]
        [
        Manager {
            name: 'clg test',
            id: 1,
            email: 'm@m.com',
            officeNumber: 1
        },
        Engineer { name: 'e', id: 2, email: 'e@e.com', github: undefined },
        Intern { name: 'i', id: 3, email: 'i@i.com', school: undefined }
        ]

2) WORKING! Github validation is not working - results in undefined. Possibly to do with axios?
    axios working correctly. currently able to check if username is correct.
    when usrename is correct it is then stored as undefined. 

3) WORKING! Intern school is resulting in undefined. Unsure why!

4) WORKING! html produced at the end of the process is not printing the results. Curent result is:
            [object Object],[object Object],[object Object]

            This is due to the data being too large. needs to be broken down.
